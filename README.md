# Trolley for Tomorrow

> Eat well. Spend smart. Waste nothing.

A food decision support application helping Australians manage food budgets, plan affordable meals, and reduce food waste. Built as part of FIT5120 Industry Experience Studio at Monash University.

---

## The Problem

Australia wastes 7.6 million tonnes of food per year. 32% of Australian households experienced food insecurity in 2024. Nearly two thirds of Australians experience decision fatigue around meal planning. This app addresses all three problems through a single unified tool.

---

## What the App Does

- Generates a personalised food score based on height, weight, budget, and dietary requirements
- Recommends affordable meals ranked by nutrition, cost, and preparation feasibility
- Scans supermarket receipts via OCR to log purchases automatically
- Tracks food waste and shows the dollar cost of what gets thrown out
- Shows nearby stores and specials to help users shop smarter

## Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, presentation-ready at all times |
| `production` | Live deployed build, only merged from main at iteration submission |
| `das` | Saubhagya's working branch |
| `arsh` | Arsh's working branch |
| `jasmine` | Jasmine's working branch |
| `karl` | Karl's working branch |
| `shimmin` | Shimmin's working branch |

**Rules:**
- Never push directly to `main` or `production`
- All changes go through a pull request
- At least one other team member must review before merging

## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/dehydrated-sushi/trolley-for-tomorrow.git
cd trolley-for-tomorrow
```

### Step 2 — Switch to your branch

Each person works only on their own branch. Never work on main directly.
```
git checkout das        # Saubhagya
git checkout arsh       # Arsh
git checkout jasmine    # Jasmine
git checkout karl       # Karl
git checkout shimmin    # Shimmin
```

### Step 3 — Check you are on the right branch
```
git branch
```

The branch with a `*` next to it is the one you are currently on. Make sure it is yours before doing anything.

### Step 4 — Before you start working, always pull latest changes
```
git pull origin main
```

This makes sure you have the latest code before you start. Do this every single time before you begin a work session.

---

## How to Save and Push Your Work

### Step 1 — Check what files you have changed
```
git status
```

### Step 2 — Stage your changes

To add everything you changed:
```
git add .
```

To add a specific file only:
```
git add backend/modules/auth/routes.py
```

### Step 3 — Commit with a proper message
```
git commit -m "feat(karl/auth): add login endpoint"
```

See the Commit Message Convention section below for the full format.

### Step 4 — Push to your branch
```
git push origin das       # replace my name with your branch name
```

---

## How to Merge Your Work into Main

When your work is ready and tested:

### Step 1 — Go to GitHub

Go to the repository on GitHub.

### Step 2 — Open a Pull Request

Click **Compare and pull request** next to your branch, or go to **Pull requests** and click **New pull request**.

Set it as:
- Base: `main`
- Compare: your branch (e.g. `das`)

### Step 3 — Write a description

Describe what you did and why. Tag a teammate to review it.

### Step 4 — Wait for approval

At least one other team member must approve before it can be merged. Do not merge your own pull request without a review.

### Step 5 — Merge

Once approved click **Merge pull request**.

---

## How to Update Your Branch with Latest Main

If main has been updated and you want those changes on your branch:
```
git checkout das          # make sure you are on your branch not mine's
git pull origin main      # pull latest main into your branch
```

If there are conflicts Git will tell you. Come to Saubhagya.

---

## Commit Message Convention

All team members must follow this format for every commit:
```
type(who/module): what you did
```

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | Adding a new feature |
| `fix` | Fixing a bug |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `data` | Data cleaning or processing work |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `refactor` | Restructuring code without changing behaviour |
| `style` | Formatting only, no logic changes |

### Examples
```
feat(das/food-score): add BMI calculation to food score calculator
fix(karl/auth): resolve JWT token expiry bug
docs(arsh/meal-ranker): update README with formula explanation
data(arsh/pipelines): clean and standardise AUSNUT nutrition data
test(jasmine/meal-plan): add unit tests for budget filtering logic
refactor(das/ocr-engine): improve receipt text parsing accuracy
```

### Rules

- Always include your name and the module you worked on
- Be specific about what you did, not just "update" or "fix stuff"
- One commit per logical change, do not bundle unrelated work into one commit
- If you are unsure what type to use, ask Saubhagya
